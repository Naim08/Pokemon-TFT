# **Project Proposal: Pokémon Auto Battler Game**

**Intro:**
**Proposal**: to create a Pokémon-themed auto battler game using vanilla JavaScript. This game will blend the captivating world of Pokémon with the strategic depth of auto battler gameplay. In this game, players will assemble a team of Pokémon and strategically position them on a battlefield to engage in automated battles against both AI-controlled opponents and other players. The goal is to provide an engaging, tactical experience that captures the essence of the Pokémon universe while offering a unique gameplay twist.

## 🚀Getting Start

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```
**To run the project:****
```
npm run dev
```



# Features:
1. **Turn-Based Gameplay:** The game will feature a turn-based structure where players take actions during their turns, including selecting and positioning Pokémon, using abilities, and managing resources. The automated battles will unfold based on the chosen strategies and Pokémon synergies.

2. **Limited Pokémon Pool:** To encourage strategic thinking and diversity in team compositions, players will have access to a limited pool of Pokémon for each match. This pool will be shared among all players, adding an element of competition as players compete for the same Pokémon.

3. **Unit Synergies and Abilities:** Pokémon will possess distinct types, abilities, and stats. Players will strategically position their Pokémon on a grid-based battlefield to trigger synergies between types and abilities. Synergies will provide bonuses that enhance gameplay strategy.

**Technical Approach:**
We will develop the game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game will be structured around a game loop that handles the flow of rounds and turns. The user interface will allow players to select and position their Pokémon on the battlefield grid. Automated battles will be determined by JavaScript logic that calculates damage and applies abilities based on Pokémon attributes.

**Scope:**
The initial version of the game will focus on core gameplay mechanics, limited Pokémon types, and a basic AI opponent. Players will be able to engage in battles against the AI and make strategic decisions during their turns. Subsequent versions could expand the game by introducing features such as multiplayer modes, additional Pokémon types, and more advanced AI opponents.

**Conclusion:**
The Pokémon Auto Battler Game aims to combine the beloved Pokémon franchise with the engaging gameplay of auto battlers. By utilizing vanilla JavaScript and a turn-based structure, we will create a strategic experience that challenges players to think critically and make calculated decisions. This project aligns with the growing interest in both auto battlers and the Pokémon universe, making it an exciting and worthwhile endeavor.
